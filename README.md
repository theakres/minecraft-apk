# Minecraft APKs
Free APK or APKS files for Minecraft Bedrock for Android. Both unlicensed (APK) and original (APKS) files are available.  
HERE ONLY RELEASES, NO BETA.

How do you figure out which file to download?  
v8a - for arm-v8a devices  
v7a - for armeabi-v7a devices  
nm - no music

Music files start with version 1.19.30. All versions below this one are without music. Please ignore the fact that there is no "nm" in the file name.

The APKS files are original. If you didn't buy Minecraft from Google Play, don't download it; it won't work. (Maybe someone will need them for experiments)

If you want to convert from APKS to APK then use this app - https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/AntiSplit-M
